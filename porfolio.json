As a software developer intern I have learnt the enterprise level coding standards, test case generations and problem solving approach. I have also worked on MySQL db, ASP.NET MVC and other technologies described under skills section. As Fresher developer I am seeking an opportunity where I can enhance my skills and use the enhanced skills to solve some interesting real life problems. It is the humongous amount of learning which motivates me and pushes me to perform beyond the limits.",
